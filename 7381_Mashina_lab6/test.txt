This film shows humanity in all its glory. We can try to claim the rich are evil and the poor deserve better but these are delusions we create to make us feel better. People are terrible. They are selfish. They are greedy. They are unkind. It's part of human nature. No matter how much you have, or how little, humanity still exists, and humanity is the problem.

All the problems in the world that make us suffer day to day are caused in the end because we are human. Nothing we can do about it.

The movie was good. Lol.
